# To-predict-the-path-each-hurricane-will-take

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tries to predict the path each hurricane will take. But hurricanes
tend to wander around aimlessly and are pushed by fronts and other weather phenomena
in their area, so they are notoriously difficult to predict. Even relatively small changes in a
hurricane’s track can make big differences in the damage it causes. The link below give
the mean error in nautical miles of the NHC’s , 24, 48 and 72-hour predictions of Atlantic hurricanes for 1970-2017. NOAA refers to these errors as the Forecast error or the
Prediction error and reports annual results.<br>

## Objectives:
- Import the data in R
- Display the 24, 48 and 72 hours errors creating appropriate graph.
- Construct 90% confidence interval for 72 hours prediction errors
